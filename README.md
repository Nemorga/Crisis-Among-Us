# Crisis : Among Us
This is the first mod in a series, each one adding a "crisis": an obstacle to standard game's progression which must be solved in order to advance. 
A crisis will generally be a setback and, I hope, will be hard to overcome. 
## Features
This mod isn't recommended on a first playthrough, knowing the base game a bit is recommanded, but it should work alright if you use it on your end-game playthrough (just be aware that your save might end up in a game-over)

### Among Us
Here the crisis is a new menace heavily inspired by Carpenter's "The Thing" or Invasion of the body snatcher. It will be tough and many of your villagers should die. 
The new menace might appear starting on the 60th moon and has more chance to appears with time and with your number of villagers (higher the chance for a higher number of villagers).
But everything isn't hopeless you're given new tools to help you:
### Spells
A new type of card, spells allow you to trigger powerful effect to help you fight, heal, feed, build or even ... raise the dead? (sort of) 
The recipe to devise such spells can be found in a new booster pack alongside the potential ingredients needed and some basic exemple of spell.
Beware, it seems that some spells(well, one of them at least) have a will of their own and may have unintended effects..
Those spell will be needed to fight the new menace (I guess you can try without them but it will be harder) and...
### A new Boss
I added a new boss who is the entity behind the menace. I think I made it rather difficult, harder than the other bosses at least. 
Without spells,it wrecked my end-game witch-defeating demon-lord-smiting army. If it's any indication of its difficulty.
You'll have the choice when to make this boss appears so you can prepare before the fight.
